Trello powerup that allows you to see the progress of any list you have in your trello board. I.e - be able to say at the top of the list 8/20 tasks complete. This is calculated from looking at how many tasks are in the list. For example 20 total tasks. And then calculates, out of those, how many are complete. You might have to create a 'Done' tickbox for users, so they can click a box saying 'Done' on the task. 
Then the list can see, how many tasks are 'Done'. E.g 8. 
So then now, the top of the list will say - 8/20 tasks complete. It'd be nice to have a visual progress bar for this too.
